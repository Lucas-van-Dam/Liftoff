# Project Liftoff
Year 1 Term 3 Project Made on top of the GXP Engine

## Description

This is the result of my team during the third project of the first year, we had to make a game that functioned with our own self made controller, and after some thinking we decided to make a fighting game, i think that in the end it worked out pretty well, and i am proud of what we have made. the project also works without a controller, since it is fully controllable by keyboard.

the engine itself has had almost no modifications, and my code on top of it is all in the folder GXPEngine2023/GXPEngine/Liftoff

## Goal

Our goal was to make a game that works with our self made controller, using the GXP engine

## Team
